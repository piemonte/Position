## Quick Start

`Position` is available for installation using the [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) or the Cocoa dependency manager [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). Alternatively, you can simply copy the `Position` source files into your Xcode project.

```ruby
# CocoaPods
pod "Position", "~> 0.10.0"

# SwiftPM
let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/piemonte/Position", majorVersion: 0)
    ]
)
```

## Platform Compatibility

`Position` supports iOS 15.0+ and macOS 11.0+. Note that some features are platform-specific:
- **Heading updates** are only available on iOS
- **Battery level monitoring** for automatic accuracy adjustment is iOS-only
- **Visit monitoring** requires iOS 15.0+ or macOS 11.0+

## Usage

The sample project provides an example of how to integrate `Position`, otherwise you can follow these steps.

Ensure your app’s `Info.plist` file includes both a location usage description, required device capability “location-services”, and  required background mode (if necessary).

See sample project for examples.

Import the file and setup your component to be a PositionObserver, if you’d like it to be a delegate.

```swift
import Position

class ViewController: UIViewController, PositionObserver {
	// ...
```

Have the component add itself as an observer and configure the appropriate settings.

```swift
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // ...

        Position.shared.addObserver(self)
        Position.shared.distanceFilter = 20

        if Position.shared.locationServicesStatus == .allowedWhenInUse ||
           Position.shared.locationServicesStatus == .allowedAlways {
            Position.shared.performOneShotLocationUpdate(withDesiredAccuracy: 250) { (location, error) -> () in
                print(location, error)
            }
        } else {
            // request permissions based on the type of location support required.
            Position.shared.requestWhenInUseLocationAuthorization()
            // Position.shared.requestAlwaysLocationAuthorization()
        }
    }
```

Observe delegation, if necessary.

```swift
    func position(position: Position, didChangeLocationAuthorizationStatus status: LocationAuthorizationStatus) {
        // location authorization did change, often this may even be triggered on application resume if the user updated settings
    }
```

**Remember** when creating location-based apps, respect the privacy of your users and be responsible for how you use their location. This is especially true if your application requires location permission `kCLAuthorizationStatusAuthorizedAlways`.

To share a location using a vCard, simply call the vCard function on any location object instance.

```swift
   let fileURL = location.vCard()
```

## Core Location Additions

Position is bundled with a variety of [additions to Core Location](https://github.com/piemonte/Position/blob/main/Sources/CoreLocation%2BAdditions.swift), such as geospatial math utilities. For example, one can calculation the direction between two coordinate points enabling [directional views](https://gist.github.com/piemonte/eb4bc7daef5b6359ec32b24b034f0c42) and other waypoint representations.
